# [NodeEvented-DrEWE](https://github.com/carloscrespog/NodeEvented-DrEWE)


Node.js module in charge of generate events and process actions. Connected with Drools module and GSN module.

It is written in node and uses the main advantage of this modern programming language: the low latency. So once a rule is triggered under the Drools or SPIN engine, it only will take fractions of a second to perform high level actions such as post a tweet, order the camera to take a photo or make the bot talk something.
