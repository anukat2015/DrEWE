An intelligent platform for task automation

## Introduction

This project aims to be a task automation platform, in a similar way to [IFTTT](www.ifttt.com), [Zapier](www.zapier.com) or [CouldWork](www.couldwork.com). It uses a new ontology or standarized schema for managing the evented web named [EWE](http://www.gsi.dit.upm.es/ontologies/ewe/), the [Drools Expert](https://www.jboss.org/drools/) rule engine to process low level events and create high level events, [SPIN](http://spinrdf.org/) SPARQL Syntax to process this high level events and order actions, [GSN](http://sourceforge.net/projects/gsn/) middleware as an Event Network and a huge variety of scripts and applications that generates events and proccess actions, such as Raspberry Pi scripts or Node.js applications.


DrEWE consist in four main modules or projects that can be found under the subtrees of this project.

### [Berries](https://github.com/carloscrespog/DrEWE/tree/master/Berries)

Raspberry Pi software 

### [Drools](https://github.com/carloscrespog/DrEWE/tree/master/Drools)

Module in charge of processing events and ordering actions. It consists in two different rule engines that work together: the Drools-based engine and the SPIN-based engine

### [GSN](https://github.com/carloscrespog/DrEWE/tree/master/GSN)

GSN is a middleware (extendible software infrastructure) for rapid deployment and integration of heterogeneous wireless sensor networks. In this project, we have implemented it as an Event Network and under this subtree we only have commited the parts that differ from the main project and the instructions to make it work.

### [NodeEvented](https://github.com/carloscrespog/DrEWE/tree/master/NodeEvented)

Under this subtree lays the module in charge of taking care of the actions such as twitter connection, email connection, web bot...

### [GCalendar-DrEWE](https://github.com/carloscrespog/GCalendar-DrEWE)

A Node.js module that simplifies the use of RESTful Google Calendar API without any interaction with the user, retrieve all events on a given calendar and send them to a GSN server. Before sending the events, it checks if it has already been added.
