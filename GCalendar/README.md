# GCalendar-DrEWE

A Node.js module that simplifies the use of RESTful Google Calendar API without any interaction with the user, retrieve all events on a given calendar and send them to a GSN server

## How to Install

```bash
npm install 
```


## How to use

```bash
node GCalendar.js 
```

Inside the config.js you can find six important parameters:

  - consumer_key    : Client ID for your project, you'll obtain it once you've registered your project in the [API Console](https://code.google.com/apis/console/)
  - consumer_secret : Client secret for your project, same as above
  - redirect_url : you must grant access to this url in the API Console,
  - access_token : access token for your application,
  - refresh_token : refresh token for your application,
  - calendarId: your calendar's ID, it can be obtained from google calendar normal service

Despite there are several methods to retrieve the token, I hardly encourage to go to [Google Oauth Playground](https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground/) and configure it to "Use your own OAuth credentials"
